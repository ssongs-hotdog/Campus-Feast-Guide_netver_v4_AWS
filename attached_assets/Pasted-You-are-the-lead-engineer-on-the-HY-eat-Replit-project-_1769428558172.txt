You are the lead engineer on the HY-eat Replit project.

Context / Bug:
- The UI renders menus correctly for “tomorrow”.
- However, menus for “the day after tomorrow” (specifically Jan 28) exist in the dataset and should be available, but they do NOT appear in the UI.
- I suspect a previous change where the “time selection” (or date/time picker logic) was intentionally made to show only “tomorrow”, and that might now be filtering out Jan 28.

Your task:
1) Reproduce and diagnose the issue end-to-end (NO assumptions).
   - Verify the dataset truly contains Jan 28 data in the expected shape and keys.
   - Verify the API endpoint(s) return Jan 28 data when requested (e.g., /api/menu?date=YYYY-MM-DD or the project’s dayKey format).
   - Verify the client request parameters and any date/dayKey generation logic for Jan 28.
   - Check for any UI filtering/guard clauses that restrict selectable dates to “tomorrow only” or otherwise block “day after tomorrow”.

2) Identify the root cause clearly.
   - Is it a date-key mismatch? (timezone/localization, formatting, dayKey generation)
   - Is it a client-side UI constraint? (date range limitation, disabled route, hidden tab)
   - Is it server-side logic? (date validation, whitelist, caching, fallback)

3) Provide a concise report in Korean to me:
   - What you checked (data → API → client)
   - What you found (with exact file paths and line numbers)
   - Root cause and why it prevents Jan 28 rendering
   - Recommended fix options (minimal/safer first)

4) If the fix is small and low-risk, implement it.
   - Keep changes minimal and localized.
   - Do not break the “tomorrow” flow.
   - Add a quick sanity check (e.g., log or small unit check) to prevent regression.

5) If the fix is not trivial, do NOT implement it.
   - Instead, propose the minimal change plan and the exact code locations.

Important:
- Please include exact code references (file paths + line numbers) in your report.
- Confirm what date format/dayKey format the system uses (e.g., "2026-01-28" vs "20260128").
- Pay special attention to timezone: user timezone is Asia/Seoul.

Output requirement:
- After your investigation (and potential small fix), respond ONLY in Korean with the report + next steps for me.
