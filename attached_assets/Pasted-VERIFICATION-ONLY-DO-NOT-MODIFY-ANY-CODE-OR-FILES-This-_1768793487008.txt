VERIFICATION ONLY — DO NOT MODIFY ANY CODE OR FILES.
This request is strictly for inspection and reporting. Do NOT implement, refactor, or update anything.
Please audit the current HY-eat project and report the data ingestion + data consumption architecture as-is.

What I need you to verify and report (current state only)
1) What data sources are currently used in runtime?

Menus: where is the menu data loaded from? (file path, format, caching behavior)

Waiting/Queue: where is the waiting data loaded from? (file path or DB or external API, caching behavior)

Any other datasets currently in use (even if optional)

For each dataset, report:

Source type: file (CSV/JSON) vs DB vs external API

Exact file path(s) or connection mechanism

When it loads: startup only vs per-request vs periodic refresh

Whether it is cached in memory, and how it is invalidated/refreshed (if at all)

2) What API endpoints serve those datasets to the client?

List the active endpoints and describe:

Request params (date/time/aggregate/etc.)

Response shape (high-level)

Which dataset/cache they read from internally

At minimum include:

/api/menu

/api/waiting

/api/waiting/all

/api/waiting/timestamps

/api/dates

/api/admin/reload (if exists)

3) Client-side data access: what does the UI actually call?

Confirm:

Whether all client data fetching routes through client/src/lib/data/dataProvider.ts

Any remaining direct fetch() calls (file + line numbers if any)

Which pages/components fetch which datasets (Home, CornerDetail, ChartsPanel, etc.)

Polling behavior: which queries poll, interval, and when polling is enabled/disabled (today-only, background tabs, etc.)

4) What datasets are the system “designed to receive” for real production?

Based on the current code/contracts, list:

The required inputs for a real deployment (minimum required datasets)

Exact required fields/columns (e.g., CSV columns: timestamp, restaurantId, cornerId, queue_len)

Any constraints (ID matching, timezone format, dateKey format, variants rules for breakfast_1000, ramen parsing rules, etc.)

5) Current data update workflow

Report how data updates are expected to happen today:

If data files change, what must happen for the server to reflect it?

Is restart required?

Or can /api/admin/reload refresh the cache?

If reload exists: what it reloads (menus, waiting, both), and whether it swaps caches atomically.

Output format (please follow)

Executive summary (5-10 lines) — what is the current ingestion architecture in one glance

Data Sources Table — dataset → source → load timing → cache/refresh

API Contract Table — endpoint → reads from → params → response shape

Client Consumption Notes — dataProvider compliance, polling, any bypasses

Production-Ready “Inputs Spec” — the exact datasets and fields we must be able to receive

Again: DO NOT CHANGE CODE. Inspection + report only.
