IMPORTANT: Please respond in Korean.

We believe the latest update has been implemented. 
Now, WITHOUT making any further code changes, please do a strict self-review + run verification tests to confirm there is zero misunderstanding and everything matches the exact spec.

========================
SCOPE (NO CODE CHANGES)
========================
- Do NOT edit/modify any files.
- Do NOT refactor or “fix” anything.
- Only inspect the current code + run tests + report results.

========================
EXPECTED FINAL SPEC (MUST VERIFY)
========================

A) Past Tab = DB-only (CSV fallback fully removed)
1) Endpoints:
- GET /api/waiting/timestamps
- GET /api/waiting
- GET /api/waiting/all

2) Response policy must be EXACT:
- If data exists for the requested date/time → 200 with data
- If data does NOT exist → 200 with empty arrays
  - timestamps endpoint: { "timestamps": [] }
  - others: []
- DB unavailable / DB query failure → 503 with { "error": "Database unavailable" }
- Invalid params → 400 with clear error message

3) Confirm there is NO remaining code path that reads from CSV for Past tab.
- If any CSV code remains, just report where it is (file + line range). Do not change it.

B) Future Tab behavior = “Future date browsing stays” but “Prediction time selector is TOMORROW-ONLY”
1) The Future tab must still allow viewing/browsing future dates (menus/info) for multiple days.
2) ONLY the “prediction time selector” must be restricted:
- Enabled ONLY when the selected date equals TOMORROW in KST (Asia/Seoul).
- Disabled/hidden for any other date, and UI must show a clear message like:
  “예측 시간 선택은 ‘내일’에만 제공됩니다.”
3) Prediction logic (when enabled):
- Uses DB averages by “same day-of-week + same 5-minute time bucket”
- All timezone logic must be KST-correct end-to-end:
  - Tomorrow computation must be based on Asia/Seoul, not server local time, not UTC
  - SQL must use timestamp AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Seoul' for DOW/time extraction
4) Confirm the final /api/predict contract:
- If /api/predict is tomorrow-only by server design, confirm it enforces tomorrow in KST.
- Confirm metadata includes:
  basedOnDays, sampleSize, confidence (high/medium/low/none), timezone, timezoneOffset, generatedAt, timeBucket, dayOfWeek/dayOfWeekName.
- Confirm confidence mapping is correct:
  >=4 high, 2-3 medium, 1 low, 0 none (predictions empty)

========================
REQUIRED VERIFICATION OUTPUT
========================
Please provide the following, in Korean:

1) “Code Inspection Summary”
- For each endpoint + feature above, list the exact file(s) and key code locations that prove the behavior (file path + approximate line range).

2) “Curl Test Results”
Run these tests and paste outputs (or summarize precisely):
A) Past endpoints:
- Data exists date (ex: 2026-01-20 if present)
  curl "http://localhost:5000/api/waiting/timestamps?date=YYYY-MM-DD"
  curl "http://localhost:5000/api/waiting?date=YYYY-MM-DD&time=HH:MM&aggregate=5min"
  curl "http://localhost:5000/api/waiting/all?date=YYYY-MM-DD"
- No data date (choose a date guaranteed to have no rows)
- Invalid date/time format → expect 400
- DB down simulation (if you can safely simulate by temporarily using a wrong DATABASE_URL in a separate run or equivalent) → expect 503
  If you cannot simulate DB down safely, state that clearly and explain what evidence you can provide instead (without code changes).

B) Future predict:
- If /api/predict requires time param:
  curl "http://localhost:5000/api/predict?time=12:30"
- Confirm the targetDate in response equals TOMORROW in KST at the moment of the test.
- Confirm confidence/basedOnDays/sampleSize behavior when data is insufficient (should return predictions: [] + confidence: none).

3) “UI Behavior Verification”
- Explain how you verified:
  - Future date browsing remains available for multiple days.
  - Prediction time selector appears ONLY for tomorrow date.
  - For non-tomorrow dates, selector disabled/hidden + message is shown.
  - Today/Past tabs still behave correctly.

4) “Final Verdict”
- PASS/FAIL for each section:
  A) Past DB-only
  B) Future tomorrow-only prediction time selector
  C) KST timezone correctness
- If FAIL or PARTIAL: list exactly what is off-spec and where.

Again: NO CODE CHANGES. Only review + tests + report.
