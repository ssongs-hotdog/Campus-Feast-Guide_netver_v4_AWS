You are making two small maintenance improvements to the existing HY-eat codebase.

ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINT:
- Do NOT change the UI/visual design/layout at all.
- Do NOT change any user-facing copy or styling.
- Only refactor constants and add server-side validation logs.

Before changes:
- Create a safe rollback point (new git commit / backup branch) so we can revert instantly if needed.
- Keep changes minimal and isolated.

IMPROVEMENT 1) Consolidate CORNER_DISPLAY_NAMES (remove duplication)
Goal:
- CORNER_DISPLAY_NAMES is currently duplicated in:
  - client/src/components/RestaurantSection.tsx
  - client/src/pages/CornerDetail.tsx
- Move it to ONE shared location and import it from both places.

Requirements:
1) Create a single shared mapping file, e.g.:
   - shared/cornerDisplayNames.ts  (or shared/constants/corners.ts)
2) Export a typed object map: Record<CornerId, string> (or equivalent).
3) Update RestaurantSection.tsx and CornerDetail.tsx to import the mapping instead of defining it locally.
4) Ensure the displayed Korean names remain EXACTLY the same as before (no changes to the UI output).

IMPROVEMENT 2) Add server-side validation warnings for unknown cornerIds in menus_by_date.json
Goal:
- When loading data/menus_by_date.json, warn if any restaurantId or cornerId keys do not match the canonical lists:
  - Canonical restaurant/corner lists come from shared/types.ts RESTAURANTS[].cornerOrder.
- This should NOT break the app. It is warnings only.

Requirements:
1) In server/routes.ts (where loadMenusByDate() reads menus_by_date.json), add a validation step:
   - Build a set of valid restaurantIds from RESTAURANTS
   - For each dateKey in the JSON:
     - For each restaurantId in that date:
       - If unknown restaurantId: console.warn with dateKey and restaurantId
       - Else for each cornerId under that restaurantId:
         - If cornerId not in RESTAURANTS[restaurantId].cornerOrder: console.warn with dateKey, restaurantId, cornerId
2) Do NOT throw errors. Only log warnings.
3) Keep runtime cost low (validate once when loading/caching).
4) Do not change the existing API response shape.

Deliverable:
- List exactly which files you changed/added.
- Confirm no UI output changed (names remain identical).
- Show example warning logs for an unknown cornerId and unknown restaurantId.
