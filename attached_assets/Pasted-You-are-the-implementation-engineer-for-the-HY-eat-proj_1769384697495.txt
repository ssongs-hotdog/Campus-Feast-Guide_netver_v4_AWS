You are the implementation engineer for the HY-eat project in Replit.

GOAL:
Apply the provided dummy menu dataset to the project so the server/client can render menus for testing.
After applying, verify behavior via API and UI, and report exactly what changed and whether everything worked.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
1) Do not use priceWon = 0 for “closed/휴무” special cases. If you see priceWon: 0 in the dataset for a closed entry, treat it as invalid and replace it with a placeholder normal price for that corner (use the standard corner pricing rules below). We must keep priceWon as an integer (schema requirement) and avoid “0 won” confusion.
2) Implement robust rollback protection before changing anything.
3) After applying, produce a clear post-apply report (files changed, validation results, tests run, issues).

STANDARD CORNER PRICING (placeholders for closed entries if needed):
- hanyang_plaza:
  breakfast_1000 = 1000
  western = 4200
  korean = 4200
  instant = 4500
  cupbap = 4500
  ramen = 3500
- materials:
  set_meal = 6000
  single_dish = 6500
  rice_bowl = 4700
  dinner = 6000
- life_science:
  dam_a_lunch = 6000
  pangeos_lunch = 6500
  dam_a_dinner = 6000

TARGET FILE:
data/menus_by_date.json (UTF-8 JSON)

INPUT DATASET:
The user will provide a JSON file content (3 weeks) that follows:
{ "YYYY-MM-DD": { "restaurantId": { "cornerId": MenuItem } } }
MenuItem required:
restaurantId, cornerId, cornerDisplayName, mainMenuName, priceWon, items
variants optional; breakfast_1000 variants can be length 1 or 2+.

TASK 0 — PRE-CHECK (READ-ONLY):
- Confirm the project currently reads from data/menus_by_date.json (or equivalent).
- Validate the dataset is parseable JSON and matches schema types.
- Ensure restaurantId/cornerId inside each MenuItem matches the parent keys.
- Ensure items is a non-empty array of strings.
- Ensure priceWon is an integer (not string/float). If any closed entry uses 0, fix to placeholder normal price for that corner.

TASK 1 — ROLLBACK PLAN (MUST DO BEFORE APPLY):
- Create a timestamped backup copy of the current data/menus_by_date.json, e.g.:
  data/menus_by_date.backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json
- If Git is available in this Replit project:
  - Commit the backup alone first with message: "backup menus_by_date before dummy dataset"
  - Then commit the new dataset as a separate commit: "apply 3-week dummy menu dataset"
- If Git is not available, at minimum keep the timestamped backup file.

TASK 2 — APPLY:
- Replace data/menus_by_date.json with the provided dummy dataset (after fixing any priceWon=0 closed entries as per constraint).
- Ensure file encoding remains UTF-8 and JSON is valid.

TASK 3 — VERIFY:
A) API checks (examples):
- Call/visit endpoints for multiple dates across the 3-week range:
  /api/menu?date=2026-01-19
  /api/menu?date=2026-01-26
  /api/menu?date=2026-02-02
- Confirm response status 200 and expected restaurant/corner keys appear.

B) UI checks:
- Open the app and verify the menu UI renders without crashes.
- Specifically check breakfast_1000 behavior:
  - If variants length is 1, it should render a single variant naturally.
  - If variants length is 2+, it should render multiple variants.
- Check closed/special-case days:
  - mainMenuName should show the provided closed text.
  - priceWon should NOT display as 0 (it should be the corner placeholder price).

TASK 4 — POST-APPLY REPORT (REQUIRED OUTPUT):
Report in a structured way:
1) What file(s) you changed and exact path(s).
2) Backup/rollback artifacts created (backup filename, commit hashes if any).
3) Any schema issues found and how you fixed them (especially any priceWon=0 cases).
4) Verification results:
   - API tests performed + outcomes
   - UI checks performed + outcomes
5) If any errors occurred:
   - Exact error logs
   - Rollback instructions executed or ready to execute

If any step fails, STOP, DO NOT GUESS, and propose the safest rollback.

Now proceed with Task 0 → Task 4.
