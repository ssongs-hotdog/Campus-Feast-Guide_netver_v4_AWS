🚫 SCOPE LOCK — MODIFY ONLY THE MINIMUM NECESSARY PARTS.
Do NOT refactor, reformat, rename unrelated things, or touch UI/visual behavior. Do NOT change any existing logic that is already working. Only implement the specific single-entrypoint cleanup described below.

Goal:
Eliminate the last remaining client-side direct fetch() that bypasses dataProvider, while preserving identical runtime behavior (same endpoint, same queryKey, same staleTime, same UI output).

Current issue:
client/src/components/ChartsPanel.tsx uses a direct fetch to:
  /api/waiting/all?date=${selectedDate}
inside a React Query queryFn. This is the only remaining bypass.

Required change (minimal):
1) Add a thin wrapper function in:
   client/src/lib/data/dataProvider.ts
   Suggested name: getAllWaitTimes(dayKey: DayKey)
   - It must call: /api/waiting/all?date=${dayKey}
   - It must return the same response pattern used by existing dataProvider functions (e.g., DataResponse<T> or the repo’s established pattern).
   - Error handling must match getWaitTimes(): non-OK responses should be represented the same way (so React Query can surface errors consistently).

2) Update ONLY the relevant queryFn block in:
   client/src/components/ChartsPanel.tsx
   - Replace the inline fetch() queryFn with a call to getAllWaitTimes(selectedDate).
   - Keep the existing queryKey EXACTLY the same (e.g., ['/api/waiting/all', selectedDate]).
   - Keep staleTime EXACTLY the same.
   - Ensure error propagation behavior stays the same as other pages:
     if the provider returns an error field, throw an Error so React Query enters the error state.
   - Do not change any chart rendering logic, props, styling, component structure, or any other code.

Hard constraints:
- No UI/visual changes.
- No changes to other files unless strictly required by TypeScript imports/types for this wrapper.
- No changes to endpoints, query keys, caching settings, or data shapes.
- Do not touch any other dataProvider functions besides adding this one function.

Acceptance checklist:
- There is no direct fetch() in ChartsPanel.tsx anymore for /api/waiting/all.
- All client data access is now routed through dataProvider as a single entrypoint.
- Charts behave exactly the same as before (same data, same refresh behavior, same loading/error behavior).
- Build/TypeScript passes with no new warnings.

After the change:
Please provide a short report listing:
- Files modified
- The exact new function signature added to dataProvider
- Confirmation that queryKey and staleTime remained unchanged
