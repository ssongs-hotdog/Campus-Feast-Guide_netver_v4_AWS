Update the time selection dropdown default state and the Active/Inactive behavior for non-today dates.

Goal:
- On past/future date pages, the time dropdown should start with NO selection and show a placeholder "-" (single dash).
- When no time is selected on past/future dates, ALL corners must be INACTIVE (gray).
- Only after the user explicitly selects a time should Active/Inactive be computed from operating schedules.

Required changes:

1) Time dropdown default (UI unchanged)
- Remove the current default selected time (e.g., "11:00").
- Represent “no selection” as null/undefined in state.
- Show placeholder text "-" when nothing is selected.
- Keep styling/layout exactly the same.

2) Reference-time rules by date type
- If a time is selected:
  - Use the selected time (HH:MM) as the reference time for schedule-based Active/Inactive on ANY date.
- If no time is selected:
  - For NON-TODAY dates (past/future): do NOT apply an internal default time.
    - Instead, force ALL corners to INACTIVE (gray).
  - (Keep TODAY behavior unchanged unless already specified elsewhere; do not redesign UI.)

3) Sorting behavior
- Keep existing sorting logic:
  - Active corners first within each restaurant.
  - If all are inactive (non-today with no selection), preserve the stable original corner order.

Constraints:
- Do NOT change UI/visual design/layout.
- Do NOT introduce new controls.
- Only adjust state/default logic and the status computation.

Validation checklist:
- Visiting any non-today /d/YYYY-MM-DD page shows time dropdown placeholder "-" initially.
- With placeholder "-" (no selection), all corners render but are gray/inactive.
- After selecting a time, corners update immediately: active = green if within operating hours (and not in break).
- Switching dates resets selection to "-" for non-today pages (unless you already intentionally persist it).
- No UI layout changes.

Deliverable:
- Indicate which component owns the time dropdown state.
- Indicate where the “non-today + no selection => all inactive” rule is implemented.
