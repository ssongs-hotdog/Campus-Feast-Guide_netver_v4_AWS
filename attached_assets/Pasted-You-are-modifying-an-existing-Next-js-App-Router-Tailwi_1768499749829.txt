You are modifying an existing Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind mobile web app.
Goal: remove the visible “blink/flicker” when simulation time advances each minute.
Do NOT redesign UI. Make minimal code changes only.

IMPORTANT SAFETY FIRST (must do before changes):
1) Create a Checkpoint/Snapshot named: "pre-smooth-update"
   OR instruct the user to Remix the project as a backup.
2) Ensure we can rollback to the exact current behavior.

========================================================
(1) Identify the cause of flicker (do not guess)
========================================================
During playback, each 1-minute tick causes the whole screen to visually blink.
Debug by checking:
A) Are we using a loading state that clears the UI each fetch?
   - e.g., setData(null) or show skeleton that replaces the list
B) Are list keys changing each tick?
   - e.g., key includes timestamp or a random value
C) Are we re-mounting the entire page due to routing or forcing refresh?
   - e.g., router.refresh(), revalidate triggers, or key on root container
D) Are we refetching in a way that causes layout reflow (full rerender)?

========================================================
(2) Implement smooth updates (minimal approach)
========================================================
Target behavior:
- Keep the existing UI on screen while fetching next minute.
- When new data arrives, update the values without unmounting/remounting components.
- No “flash” to empty state.

Required changes:
1) Keep previous snapshot while fetching:
   - Do NOT clear data on fetch.
   - Use a separate state: isFetchingNext boolean
   - Update data only when new response arrives.

2) Stable keys:
   - For restaurant sections and corner cards, keys must be stable:
     use `${restaurantId}-${cornerId}` only.
   - NEVER include timestamp in the React key.

3) Avoid page remount:
   - Do not key the root container by time.
   - Do not call router.refresh() each tick.

4) Optional (recommended) crossfade micro-transition:
   - Add a very subtle CSS transition so value changes feel smooth:
     e.g., apply transition on opacity/transform to the numbers only
     (NOT a full-screen fade).
   - Example: when data updates, briefly animate the wait time text from
     opacity-80 to opacity-100 (150ms).
   - Keep it subtle and fast.

5) Reduce unnecessary refetch:
   - If the API result for a timestamp was already loaded, cache it in memory
     (Map keyed by timestamp string) and reuse it.
   - This will reduce jank and network overhead.

========================================================
(3) Acceptance criteria
========================================================
- When autoplay advances minute by minute, the page should NOT blink.
- The content updates smoothly (values change) without showing empty states.
- No change to functionality: time controls, stats, tickets remain working.

========================================================
(4) Deliverables
========================================================
- Implement the fix and briefly explain:
  - What caused flicker
  - What was changed (file names)
  - How rollback works (checkpoint name: pre-smooth-update)
