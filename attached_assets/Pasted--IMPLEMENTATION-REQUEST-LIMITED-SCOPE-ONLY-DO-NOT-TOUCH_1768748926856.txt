🚨 IMPLEMENTATION REQUEST — LIMITED SCOPE ONLY (DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING ELSE)
This update is a STRICT special-case for ONE corner only:
hanyang_plaza / breakfast_1000 (천원의 아침밥).
Do NOT change any global UI styling, layouts, typography, spacing, colors, routing, component structure, or behavior for any other corner.
Keep the existing UI visuals identical except for the additions described below.

ROLLBACK SAFETY REQUIREMENT
- If you encounter unexpected type errors, runtime errors, or any behavior changes outside breakfast_1000,
  STOP and revert/rollback to the previous working state before reporting back.
- Keep changes minimal, localized, and easily reversible.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CONTEXT
- Currently each corner’s menu data uses a single mainMenuName and a single items[] list.
- For breakfast_1000 only, we need to support TWO separate “main menus”, derived from:
  - Variant #1: first menu name from “[백반식] …”
  - Variant #2: first menu name from “[간편식] …”
- The server returns menu JSON as pass-through via /api/menu (no transformation).
- The client renders CornerCard (home list) and CornerDetail (detail page).
- We also want to reserve a UI placeholder for a future real-time dataset:
  “remaining meal tickets” (잔여 식수) for breakfast_1000 only.

GOALS
A) Data Model Upgrade (breakfast_1000 only, backward compatible)
1) breakfast_1000 may have:
   - 2 variants (main #1 and main #2) each with its own items list, OR
   - 1 variant (only main #1) with its items list
2) All non-breakfast corners remain unchanged (single mainMenuName + items[]).

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH (preferred)
- Extend MenuItem with an OPTIONAL field used only for breakfast_1000:
  variants?: Array<{ mainMenuName: string; items: string[] }>
- For normal corners: variants is undefined (do NOT add variants: []).
- For breakfast_1000: variants length is 1 or 2 ONLY (never empty).
- Precedence rule (IMPORTANT):
  - If breakfast_1000 has variants with length >= 1, UI must render from variants.
  - Otherwise (no variants), fall back to legacy mainMenuName/items.
- Keep legacy fields (mainMenuName/items) intact for backward compatibility and fallback rendering.

Type-safety / edge-case handling requirements
- Add explicit guards so variants: [] does NOT break rendering:
  - Treat empty variants as “no variants” and fall back cleanly.
- Ensure no “dual schema confusion”:
  - Only breakfast_1000 is allowed to use variants; all other corners ignore/omit it.

B) Home Screen (CornerCard) Rendering Rule
- For breakfast_1000 only:
  - If there are TWO variants: display “Main1, Main2” (comma-separated) in the EXACT same UI location where mainMenuName is currently shown.
  - If there is ONE variant: display only “Main1” cleanly (no comma, no placeholders).
  - If there are NO variants: display legacy mainMenuName as before.
- For all other corners: NO CHANGES.

C) Detail Screen (CornerDetail) Rendering Rule — IMPORTANT
Current detail UI shows ONE “menu block” containing:
- photo placeholder (left)
- main menu name + composition items (right)
- and currently a single “결제하기” action flow

For breakfast_1000 ONLY, change the detail page so that:
1) If there are TWO variants: render TWO independent menu blocks stacked vertically.
   - Block #1 corresponds to variant #1 (Main1 + its items list)
   - Block #2 corresponds to variant #2 (Main2 + its items list)
2) If there is ONE variant: render ONE menu block (same structure).
3) Add a new text label inside EACH breakfast_1000 menu block at the BOTTOM-RIGHT:
   - “잔여 식수: --명”
   Notes:
   - This is a placeholder for future real-time data.
   - Do NOT implement data fetching now.
   - Keep “--” literally as the placeholder value.
4) Payment / ticket creation behavior (RESOLVES the “which variant?” risk):
   - Each breakfast_1000 variant block must have its OWN “결제하기” button/action.
   - Clicking “결제하기” on Block #1 must create a ticket using variant #1’s mainMenuName (and the shared priceWon=1000).
   - Clicking “결제하기” on Block #2 must create a ticket using variant #2’s mainMenuName (and the shared priceWon=1000).
   - If only one variant exists, only one “결제하기” is shown (same as before).
5) The menu blocks must reuse the existing block style/layout (NO redesign). Simply duplicate the existing block markup for breakfast variants and keep the visual style consistent.

D) Constraints & Quality Bar
- Minimal changes only; do not refactor unrelated code.
- Keep TypeScript types correct and consistent across shared/types and client.
- Ensure the app works when breakfast_1000 has:
  - 2 variants
  - 1 variant
  - no variants (legacy fallback)
- Ensure other corners render EXACTLY as before (no layout/behavior change).
- Maintain graceful behavior when there is no menu data (“데이터 없음”) for any date/corner.

DELIVERABLES (after implementation)
1) List the exact files changed.
2) Summarize the final type shape for MenuItem/MenuVariant and how breakfast_1000 uses it.
3) Confirm with a checklist:
   - CornerCard shows “Main1, Main2” for breakfast_1000 when 2 variants exist
   - CornerCard shows only “Main1” when only 1 variant exists
   - CornerCard fallback works when variants missing/empty
   - CornerDetail shows 2 stacked menu blocks for breakfast_1000 when 2 variants exist
   - CornerDetail shows 1 menu block for breakfast_1000 when 1 variant exists
   - Each breakfast block shows “잔여 식수: --명” at bottom-right
   - Each breakfast block has its own “결제하기” and generates a ticket with that variant’s name
   - Other corners unchanged (no “잔여 식수”, no extra blocks, no extra payment buttons)
   - No TypeScript errors, no runtime errors
