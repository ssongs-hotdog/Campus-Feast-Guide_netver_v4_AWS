REQUEST: SAFE CLEANUP BEFORE PHASE 1 (NO AWS CHANGES YET)

You are a senior full-stack engineer maintaining the HY-eat Replit project.

Context:
We are about to start Phase 1 (AWS S3 menu integration). Before doing that, I want to remove the existing local dummy menu dataset from the production codebase because I already saved a backup on my computer, and I do not need to keep it inside the repo.

Goal:
- Cleanly remove the old local dummy menu dataset and any related references, so the project is ready for Phase 1.
- Keep the app stable and buildable after cleanup.
- Do NOT start AWS integration in this step.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1) Please answer in Korean.
2) Make changes safely and minimally.
3) Before editing anything, first do a READ-ONLY inspection and list exactly:
   - Which files currently store local menu dummy data (e.g., data/menus_by_date.json or other menu files)
   - Which server routes or code paths read those files (e.g., /api/menu implementation in server/routes.ts or storage.ts)
   - Which client code calls /api/menu (do not change client unless absolutely necessary)

Cleanup requirements:
A) Delete the local dummy menu dataset file(s) from the repository (e.g., data/menus_by_date.json) and any other menu dummy data artifacts.
B) Update the server so the application still runs without crashing:
   - If /api/menu depends on local files, update it to return a clear, consistent error response when menu data is not available yet (e.g., 404 with { error: "MENU_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE" }).
   - Keep response format predictable so the frontend does not hard-crash. If necessary, return an empty object with a warning message, but be consistent.
C) Remove any unused imports, dead code, or references specifically tied to the deleted menu dummy files.
D) Do NOT remove waiting queue data or database logic. This cleanup is ONLY for local menu dummy data.
E) After changes, confirm:
   - `npm run dev` still starts successfully
   - `/api/health` still works
   - `/api/menu?date=YYYY-MM-DD` returns the new “not available” response cleanly (no server crash)
   - The UI does not crash (it can show an empty state or error message)

Deliverables:
1) A short summary in Korean of what you found (files and references).
2) A step-by-step change plan.
3) Then apply the changes.
4) Provide a final verification checklist and any rollback tips (e.g., how to restore the deleted file if needed).
