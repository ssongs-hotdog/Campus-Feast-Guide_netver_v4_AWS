I want an architecture + operations readiness review of my HY-eat web service to answer this question:

“Is a real server actually set up right now, and can it handle real-service traffic (concurrent users) — or is this only a demo/PoC runtime?”

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS
- DO NOT modify any code or files.
- DO NOT change any settings, environment variables, workflows, deployments, or database schema.
- This request is review + reporting ONLY.
- If you need to verify something, explain WHERE you checked (Workflows panel, deployment settings, runtime, logs, server entrypoint, env vars, DB config, etc.) and what evidence you saw.

Please produce a structured report with the sections below.

------------------------------------------------------------
1) Define what “the server” is in this project (current reality)
- What component is acting as the server? (e.g., Node/Express in server/routes.ts, Vite dev server, etc.)
- How is it started right now? (Workflows / Run button / “Start application” command)
- Is it a deployed/public server or just a dev/test runtime? Clarify the difference clearly.

------------------------------------------------------------
2) Hosting / Deployment diagnosis (Replit context)
Provide a table of what is true right now:
- Runtime type: Replit Dev vs Replit Deployment vs Autoscale (what it appears to be)
- Single instance vs multi-instance scalability
- Process lifecycle: restart behavior, uptime expectations, sleeping/pausing risks
- Network exposure: is there a stable public URL, reverse proxy, TLS, etc. (as applicable)
- Frontend serving: how static assets are served (same server vs separate hosting/CDN)
- Logging/monitoring: what exists besides /api/health (if anything)

If something is uncertain, mark it explicitly as “Uncertain” and list exactly where I should check.

------------------------------------------------------------
3) Traffic / concurrency capacity and bottleneck risk assessment
Assume lunch peak traffic with polling:
- Example concurrent users: 200, 500, 1000, 2000
- Today tab polls every 30 seconds (React Query), plus normal browsing requests.

For each concurrency level:
- Roughly estimate requests per second (RPS) and what endpoints get hit most.
- Identify bottlenecks: CPU/memory, Node event loop, DB query load, DB connection limits, file cache access, etc.
- Evaluate whether current DB indexing and query patterns are adequate.
- Evaluate whether Replit environment limits would become a blocker (single instance, resource limits, restarts).

------------------------------------------------------------
4) Verdict: Is it “production-ready” today?
Give a clear verdict:
- “PoC/Demo only”
- “Small production possible (limited scale)”
- “Not ready for real service”

And provide a checklist of what is missing for real service readiness.

------------------------------------------------------------
5) If we need to build/upgrade for real service: difficulty + roadmap
Provide a prioritized roadmap from Beta → Production:
- Hosting choice and deployment model (server/frontend separation if needed)
- Scaling strategy (multi-instance, autoscaling, load balancing)
- DB hardening (connection pooling, indexes, query optimization)
- Caching (e.g., Redis), rate limiting, and resilience
- Replace polling with push (WebSocket/SSE) — optional but evaluate
- Observability: metrics/logging/alerts
- Security: auth, tokens, secrets handling, abuse prevention

For each item:
- Difficulty (Low/Medium/High)
- Scope (infra vs code vs both)
- “Must-have for beta” vs “Must-have for production” vs “Nice-to-have”

------------------------------------------------------------
6) Minimize questions — use assumptions instead
Do NOT ask me multiple follow-up questions.
If information is missing, write:
- “Uncertain (insufficient evidence)”
- “Where to verify”
- “Most likely scenario A/B”

------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT
- Executive Summary (3–6 bullets)
- Current State Diagram (text-based)
- Bottlenecks & Risks Table
- Readiness Verdict (PoC / Small Prod / Not Ready)
- Roadmap (Beta → Production), prioritized
