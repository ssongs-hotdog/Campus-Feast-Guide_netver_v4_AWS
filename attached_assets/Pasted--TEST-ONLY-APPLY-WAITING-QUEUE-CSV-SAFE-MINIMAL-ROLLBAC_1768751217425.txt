🚨 TEST-ONLY APPLY (WAITING/QUEUE CSV) — SAFE, MINIMAL, ROLLBACKABLE
Do NOT refactor any code. Do NOT change UI. Do NOT change APIs or domain logic.
This is ONLY to apply a provided dummy waiting/queue CSV dataset for testing and then report results.
If anything unexpected happens (server crash, runtime error, UI break, API errors), STOP and rollback immediately.

Input File (provided by user)
- hy_eat_queue_2026-01-12_to_2026-01-17_1min.csv

Target (current server expects this exact path/name)
- data/hy_eat_queue_3days_combined.csv

Steps (safe procedure)
1) Backup any existing CSV (if present):
   - If data/hy_eat_queue_3days_combined.csv exists:
     copy it to data/hy_eat_queue_3days_combined.csv.bak

2) Apply the new dataset:
   - Copy/overwrite:
     hy_eat_queue_2026-01-12_to_2026-01-17_1min.csv
     → data/hy_eat_queue_3days_combined.csv

3) Server restart requirement (CSV is loaded at startup)
   - Restart the server/app so loadAllWaitingData() reloads the CSV.
   - Confirm logs show CSV loaded successfully (not “CSV file not found”).

4) API sanity checks (must reflect new dates)
   - Call /api/dates
     Expected: dates includes 2026-01-12 through 2026-01-17 (sorted)
   - Call /api/waiting/timestamps?date=2026-01-12
     Expected: timestamps populated (many entries)
   - Call /api/waiting/all?date=2026-01-12
     Expected: non-empty array with fields including timestamp, restaurantId, cornerId, queue_len, est_wait_time_min
   - (Optional) Call /api/waiting?date=2026-01-12&time=12:00&aggregate=5min
     Expected: returns aggregated data; values look reasonable around lunch peak.

5) UI verification (no redesign)
Home page:
- Navigate to /d/2026-01-12 and select a time (e.g., 12:00).
  Expected:
  - Active/Inactive dots reflect operating hours (ramen break window, etc.)
  - Cards show estimated wait times (numbers) instead of “-” where data exists
  - Congestion bars show variation (not all identical)
ChartsPanel:
- Should display lines/trends for queue_len and est_wait_time_min for the selected restaurant/corner.
- Confirm no console errors.

6) Report back (no extra changes)
- Confirm only the CSV file was swapped (plus backup).
- Provide pass/fail for:
  - /api/dates includes 2026-01-12~2026-01-17
  - timestamps populated for at least one date
  - /api/waiting/all returns non-empty
  - UI shows non-empty wait times when a valid time is selected
- If any check fails: rollback by restoring the backup CSV and report the error.

Rollback instructions
- Restore:
  data/hy_eat_queue_3days_combined.csv.bak → data/hy_eat_queue_3days_combined.csv
- Restart server again.
