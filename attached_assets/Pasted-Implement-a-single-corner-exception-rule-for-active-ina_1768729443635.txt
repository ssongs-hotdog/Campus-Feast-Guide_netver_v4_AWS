Implement a single-corner exception rule for active/inactive status.

ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINT:
- Do NOT change the UI/visual design/layout.
- Keep the existing schedule-based active/gray logic for all other corners unchanged.
- Apply this rule ONLY to the specified corner.

Requirement:
For the corner:
- restaurantId: "materials" (신소재공학관)
- cornerId: "rice_bowl" (덮밥)

Active/Inactive override rule:
- This corner should be ACTIVE (green) ONLY when BOTH conditions are true:
  1) The reference time is within its operating schedule window (existing schedule rule)
  2) Menu data exists for this exact dateKey + restaurantId + cornerId
     i.e., menusByDate[dateKey]?.[restaurantId]?.[cornerId] is present
- If menu data is missing for that date, force this corner to INACTIVE (gray),
  even if the time is within the operating schedule.

Notes:
- This is needed because this corner operates irregularly on some days, and menu data presence is the signal for “open today”.
- Do NOT apply this behavior to any other corner.

Implementation guidance (keep it clean):
1) Add an optional per-corner “requiresMenuDataForActive” flag (or equivalent) in the canonical corner config.
   - Default: false for all corners
   - Set true only for materials/rice_bowl
2) In the status computation layer (NOT inside presentational UI components), compute:
   - baseIsActive = schedule-based active rule
   - hasMenuData = Boolean(menuData[restaurantId]?.[cornerId])
   - finalIsActive =
       if requiresMenuDataForActive: baseIsActive && hasMenuData
       else: baseIsActive
3) Keep sorting logic consistent (active corners first). This corner should follow the finalIsActive state.

Validation checklist:
- For materials/rice_bowl:
  - Within schedule + menu data present => ACTIVE (green)
  - Within schedule + menu data missing => INACTIVE (gray)
  - Outside schedule => INACTIVE regardless of menu data
- All other corners: unchanged behavior (schedule-only active/gray)

Deliverable:
- Specify the file(s) where the per-corner flag is defined and where finalIsActive is computed.
- Confirm UI output did not change other than the intended status behavior for this corner.
