🚫 REVIEW ONLY — NO CODE CHANGES, NO DATA GENERATION.
Do NOT modify code, add files, or generate CSVs. This request is strictly for inspection, reasoning, and reporting.

Context:
We have removed all PoC CSV waiting datasets, and the app is now running in a clean “skeleton mode” with graceful no-data behavior.
We plan to next introduce TEST dummy data that mimics what a real production service would eventually receive.

I want you to review and report on the following:

A) What data inputs would this service realistically receive in production?
- List the minimal and sufficient data sources required for the service to function as designed.
- Validate whether the following assumption is correct:
  1) Real-time or time-indexed waiting queue data per corner
  2) Date-based menu data per corner
- If additional data inputs are required (now or in foreseeable extensions), list them and explain why.

B) For each required data input, specify the exact variables that matter
For each dataset (e.g., waiting data, menu data), clearly enumerate:
- Required fields (must-have)
- Optional or derived fields
- Fields that are NOT needed (and should not be included in test data)

Focus on what is actually used by:
- server logic,
- shared domain logic,
- dataProvider,
- and UI rendering.

C) Dummy data design guidance (for a tester who will create CSV fixtures)
Without generating data, provide guidance for someone who will create test CSV datasets:
- What structural rules must be respected (IDs, time granularity, date format, coverage)?
- What common mistakes would break the app or cause misleading behavior?
- What patterns should be reflected to make the dummy data realistic (e.g., lunch peaks, corner-specific behavior)?
- What simplifications are acceptable for testing purposes?

D) Validation mindset
Explain how we should judge whether a dummy dataset is “good enough”:
- What behaviors in the UI/API should be observed if the data is correct?
- What warning signs indicate malformed or poorly designed test data?

Again: this is analysis and reporting only — no code or data changes.
