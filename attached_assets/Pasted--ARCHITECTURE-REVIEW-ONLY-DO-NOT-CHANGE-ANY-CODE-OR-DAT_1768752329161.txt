🚫 ARCHITECTURE REVIEW ONLY — DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE OR DATA
This request is strictly for internal inspection and analysis.
Do NOT modify code, do NOT refactor, do NOT edit any files, do NOT generate patches/diffs, and do NOT apply updates.
Please only read the repository and report your findings.

Goal
I want a professional “service-base architecture” audit:
- Is the current structure clean and coherent as a long-term service base?
- Are there any structural issues, hidden coupling, or design debt that will hurt us later?
- Is the separation of UI / domain logic / data access actually enforced in practice?
- Are there any obvious improvements that are recommended (but do NOT implement them)?

Audit Scope (what to analyze)
1) Layering / Separation of Concerns
- UI components: purely render, minimal logic leakage?
- Data access: dataProvider as single client entrypoint? any remaining bypasses?
- Domain logic: single source of truth (wait time, schedule rules, congestion)?
- Server responsibilities: data ingestion (CSV/JSON), caching, endpoints: clean boundaries?

2) Data Contracts & Type System
- shared/types.ts as canonical contract between server/client?
- API response shapes consistent and stable?
- Special cases isolated (breakfast_1000 variants, ramen break, rice_bowl menu-dependent active)?
- Error handling consistency (DataResponse, react-query patterns)

3) Routing & State Model
- Date routing (/d/YYYY-MM-DD) behavior consistent and robust?
- Time selection behavior matches policy (today vs past/future)?
- “No time selected → all inactive” invariant enforced?

4) Reliability / Operational Readiness
- Startup caching: predictable? failure modes safe?
- Missing data behavior: graceful placeholders everywhere?
- Observability: warnings/logging for bad IDs/data?
- Performance risks: file size growth, memory, client query volume?

5) Maintainability / Extensibility
- How hard is it to replace CSV/JSON with DB/API later?
- What parts are most likely to break when we add real-time updates?
- Where is the design most brittle?

Deliverables (report format)
A) Architecture Verdict
- PASS / PASS WITH MINOR ISSUES / NEEDS WORK
- 3–5 bullet justification

B) Strengths (what is already solid)
- List the top 5

C) Weaknesses / Risks (prioritized)
- List top 5 with severity (High/Med/Low) and WHY

D) Recommended Improvements (non-blocking, do not implement)
- List 5–10 improvements, each with:
  - scope (client/server/shared)
  - expected benefit
  - risk level
  - “must do now?” (yes/no)

E) One-page “Future-proofing” Notes
- What to keep invariant as we migrate to real data / real-time

Please keep the report concrete: cite file paths / modules / key functions when making claims.
