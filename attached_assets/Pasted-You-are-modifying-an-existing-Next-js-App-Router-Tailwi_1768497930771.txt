You are modifying an existing Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind mobile web app.
Make minimal targeted changes only.
Do NOT redesign UI, do NOT change colors, do NOT refactor unrelated code.
Fix exactly the items below and verify them.

========================================================
(1) BUG: Main page vs Detail page values mismatch
========================================================
Symptom:
On the main list page, each corner card shows est_wait_time_min + congestion.
But on the corner detail page, the shown est_wait_time_min + congestion do NOT match the main page.

Root cause is likely inconsistent time snapshot usage.
Required behavior:
- Main and detail must use the exact same displayTime snapshot.
- If the app is in simulation mode (slider), detail must reflect that same slider time.
- If in realtime mode, detail must reflect realtime.

Implementation requirement (preferred, minimal risk):
A) When navigating to detail page, include displayTime as query param:
   e.g. /restaurant/[restaurantId]/corner/[cornerId]?t=<ISO_WITH_+09:00>
B) In the detail page, use that `t` to request the SAME snapshot from /api/waiting:
   /api/waiting?t=<ISO...>
C) Ensure /api/waiting supports `t` and returns rows for the closest matching minute.
D) Use the returned row’s est_wait_time_min to compute congestion levels.
E) Confirm that the main page and detail page show identical wait time + congestion for same corner at same time.

Add a small debug line (can be hidden in a subtle style) that shows:
- loadedDataTimestamp: HH:mm
on BOTH main and detail, so we can verify they match.

Acceptance test:
- Set simulation to 12:15 and open ramen corner detail:
  main and detail must match exactly.

========================================================
(1-1) BUG: Stats panel dropdowns not opening
========================================================
Symptom:
In the “통계/그래프” panel, restaurant/corner selectors exist but clicking does not open options.

Fix:
- Make selectors fully interactive on top of overlays.
- Common causes to check/fix:
  - parent container has overflow:hidden clipping the dropdown menu
  - dropdown menu z-index too low (behind bottom sheet)
  - pointer-events: none on overlay layers
  - focus trap preventing click
- If using shadcn/ui Select/Popover:
  - ensure the popover is portalled to document.body or has high z-index
  - ensure the bottom sheet overlay does not block clicks on the select trigger
- If simplest is safer, replace custom dropdown with native <select> controls inside the panel.
  (But keep the same labels and layout.)

Acceptance test:
- Clicking restaurant opens list
- selecting restaurant updates corner list
- clicking corner opens list and selection updates charts

========================================================
(2) UI: Center the “통계” button
========================================================
Currently the “통계/그래프” button is stuck to far left.
Move it to the horizontal center of the screen.

Requirement:
- On mobile width, the button should be centered.
- Use flex container with justify-center or equivalent.
- Do not change size/colors unnecessarily.

========================================================
(2-2) Rename app title: H-Eat -> HY-eat
========================================================
Change the displayed app name anywhere it appears (header/title/metadata) from:
- "H-Eat" / "H-eat" / "HEat" etc.
to:
- "HY-eat"

Also update:
- <title> in layout/head metadata
- any visible top header brand string
Do NOT change URLs or IDs unless they explicitly show the app name.

========================================================
(3) Deliverables
========================================================
After changes, summarize:
- which files were changed
- what the fix was for each item
and confirm all acceptance tests passed.
