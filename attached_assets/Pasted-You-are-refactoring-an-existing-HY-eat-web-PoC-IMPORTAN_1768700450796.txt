You are refactoring an existing HY-eat web PoC. IMPORTANT: Keep the current UI/visual design and layout EXACTLY the same (no redesign, no spacing/typography changes unless strictly necessary for the requested behavior). The goal is to build a clean, service-ready base architecture where UI is stable and data/logic are modular.

Context / Intent
- The main UI is already considered final and must remain unchanged.
- We want a scalable base for future real-time integrations (queue counts from cameras, payment module, operational data).
- For now, we are still using local dummy JSON (Option B), but we want the code structured so later switching to API/DB is easy without touching UI components.

Key Requirements (must implement)
1) Date routing & navigation (service-ready)
- The app must use URL-based date routing: /d/YYYY-MM-DD
- Prev/Next date buttons should navigate by changing the URL date.
- The “today” baseline must be derived from the user’s actual current date (local time), not a hardcoded Jan 15 baseline.
- If user visits root (/) redirect to /d/<todayKey>.

2) Data-provider driven rendering (UI must not know data availability)
- Implement a data provider layer (e.g., src/data/ or lib/data/) that exposes functions like:
  - getDayData(dateKey: string): returns the day’s restaurant/corner/menu data or a “no-data” status.
- UI components should always receive a consistent shape of data (avoid UI-level branching like `if (!data) show empty page`).
- Remove/avoid the current “full-page empty state” for missing dates.
  Instead, the UI should render the SAME screen structure as days with data.

3) “No data” behavior inside the SAME UI skeleton (corner-count placeholders)
- When a date has no menu/wait/congestion data:
  - Still render the same restaurant and corner sections/cards in the list view.
  - The number of placeholder menu cards must equal the number of corners (exactly one per corner).
  - For each placeholder card:
    - Menu name field: display "데이터 없음" (or equivalent existing language used in the UI)
    - Estimated wait time field: display "-" (dash) instead of a number
    - Congestion indicator/label: show "미제공" (and use a neutral/gray visual state if your existing UI supports it without redesign)
- Keep restaurant name, fixed restaurant info UI, corner name chips/badges, etc. consistent with the current design.

4) Detail page must match selected date (and support “no data” placeholders)
- When clicking a menu card from any date, the detail view must show data for that same dateKey (fix the bug where detail always shows “today” data).
- For no-data placeholder items, detail page should still open (do NOT block clicks).
  - It should render the same detail UI but show:
    - Menu name: "데이터 없음"
    - Wait time: "-"
    - Congestion: "미제공"
    - Any other dynamic fields: show "미제공" or "-" consistently
- The detail route should include dateKey and item id (recommended):
  - /d/YYYY-MM-DD/menu/<menuId>
  so it is shareable and reproducible.

5) Clean modular architecture for future upgrades (very important)
- Separate concerns into clear modules:
  - data layer: reading local JSON now, later replace with API (same function signatures)
  - domain layer: wait-time calculation logic (even if currently stubbed)
  - UI layer: purely presentational components
- No hardcoded menu names inside UI components. All menu names must come from data provider outputs.
- Add beginner-friendly comments in each module explaining:
  - what the module does
  - what can change later (e.g., “replace this JSON loader with API fetch”)
  - how dateKey is computed

Implementation Guidance (do not change UI)
- Keep the current styling and existing components.
- Only adjust code structure and data flow to achieve the behaviors above.
- If you need to add types/interfaces, do so in a shared types file (e.g., shared/types.ts).
- Ensure navigation/selection state is driven by the URL (dateKey, menuId).
- Preserve existing Korean labels where they already exist; only add the new strings: "데이터 없음", "미제공", "-" as required.

Deliverables
- Updated code with the refactor and bug fixes implemented.
- Brief checklist in comments or a short note summarizing what changed and where:
  - date routing entry point
  - data provider functions
  - placeholder generation for missing dates (corner-count)
  - detail page date alignment fix
