You are working inside the existing HY-eat Replit project.

GOAL (must not change UI/visual design):
Fix a bug where on Yesterday/Today/Tomorrow pages, clicking a menu card opens a detail view that always shows TODAY’s menu data. The detail view must show the menu item that matches the date the user was browsing.

NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change the current UI layout, styling, spacing, typography, or component structure beyond what is strictly necessary to fix the bug.
- Keep the exact same design and user flow; only fix data/date mapping for the detail page.
- Keep existing components; prefer adding minimal props/route params rather than rewriting screens.

DIAGNOSIS (what’s likely happening):
The detail page is reading menu data from a “today” source (hardcoded or default store state) instead of using the selected date context from the list page. The selected date context is lost during navigation.

REQUIRED FIX (implementation approach):
1) Make the selected date an explicit part of navigation into the detail view.
   - When a user clicks a menu card on a date page, navigate to the detail route while carrying the date.
   - Use one of these options (pick the one that fits current routing best):
     A) Query param: /menu/:menuId?date=YYYY-MM-DD
     B) Path param: /d/:date/menu/:menuId
   - Prefer A (query param) if routing changes are harder, because it’s minimal.

2) On the detail page, derive the active date ONLY from the URL (query or params), not from a “today” constant.
   - Parse the date from the URL.
   - If date is missing, fallback gracefully to “today” and display a subtle console warning (no UI changes).

3) Use the parsed date to select the correct menu item.
   - Ensure the detail page selects the menu item from the dataset belonging to that date (yesterday/today/tomorrow), not from a shared “today” array.
   - The selection should be: menu = menusByDate[date].find(m => m.id === menuId)
   - If not found, show an existing “not found”/empty state if already present; otherwise render a minimal text message without changing layout.

4) Ensure list pages pass the correct date consistently.
   - Yesterday page passes yesterdayDate, Today page passes todayDate, Tomorrow page passes tomorrowDate.
   - If there is a “simulation time” feature, ensure the same computed date is used both for list rendering and for the navigation parameter.

WHAT TO CHANGE (be specific and minimal):
- Identify the component that handles clicking a menu card (e.g., MenuCard / MenuList item).
  - Update its onClick handler to include the date in navigation.
- Identify the detail page component (e.g., MenuDetail / DetailView).
  - Update data loading/selection so it uses the URL-provided date.
- If a router file exists, update the route definition only as needed to accept query/params.
- Do NOT refactor unrelated files.

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
- On Yesterday page, click any menu → detail shows yesterday’s corresponding menu name/category/wait time.
- On Tomorrow page, click any menu → detail shows tomorrow’s corresponding menu.
- Today page behavior remains unchanged (still correct).
- Browser refresh on a detail URL still shows correct data (because date is in URL).
- No visual changes to UI.

DELIVERABLE:
- Implement the fix in code.
- Provide a short summary:
  - Which files were changed
  - What route format was chosen (query param or path param)
  - How date is parsed and how the correct menu is selected
  - Quick manual test steps and expected results
