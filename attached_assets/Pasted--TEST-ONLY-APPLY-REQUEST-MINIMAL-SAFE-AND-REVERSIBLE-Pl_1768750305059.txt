🚨 TEST-ONLY APPLY REQUEST — MINIMAL, SAFE, AND REVERSIBLE
Please DO NOT refactor any code. Do NOT change UI design. Do NOT touch routing or business logic.
This is ONLY to apply a provided dummy menu dataset file for testing and then report results.
If anything unexpected happens (build error, runtime error, UI break, type error), STOP and rollback to the previous state immediately.

Goal
- Replace the current menu dataset file with the provided dummy dataset JSON
- Verify that menus render correctly for 2026-01-12 ~ 2026-01-24
- Especially verify the breakfast_1000 special-case behavior (variants blocks + per-block payment + remaining tickets placeholder)
- Produce a short verification report with screenshots (if possible) and a checklist.

Input File (provided by user)
- menus_by_date_2026-01-12_to_2026-01-24.json
(Apply its contents into: data/menus_by_date.json)

Steps (safe procedure)
1) Backup the existing menu file (even if empty):
   - Copy data/menus_by_date.json → data/menus_by_date.json.bak

2) Apply the dummy dataset:
   - Replace/overwrite data/menus_by_date.json with the contents of menus_by_date_2026-01-12_to_2026-01-24.json

3) Run the app and do sanity checks:
   - Confirm server starts without errors
   - Confirm /api/menu?date=2026-01-12 returns populated data
   - Confirm /api/menu?date=2026-01-24 returns populated data
   - Confirm /api/menu?date=2026-01-18 (Sunday) returns empty or missing (expected)

4) UI checklist (must match current UI; no redesign)
Home (/d/2026-01-12):
   - Confirm each restaurant section shows menus (not "데이터 없음") where data exists
   - For hanyang_plaza / breakfast_1000:
       * If variants exist: main title shows "Main1, Main2" comma-separated
       * If only 1 variant exists: shows only "Main1"
CornerDetail for breakfast_1000 (/d/2026-01-12 → click breakfast_1000):
   - If 2 variants: TWO stacked menu blocks rendered
   - Each block shows:
       * correct main menu name for that variant
       * items list for that variant
       * bottom-right label: "잔여 식수: --명"
       * its own "결제하기" button
   - Clicking each block’s "결제하기" creates a ticket using THAT variant’s mainMenuName and shows priceWon=1000 on the ticket page
CornerDetail for a normal corner (e.g., hanyang_plaza/korean):
   - Still shows exactly ONE menu block as before
   - No "잔여 식수" label
   - "결제하기" behavior unchanged

5) Report back (no extra changes)
- List what you changed (should only be the JSON file swap + backup)
- Confirm no code files changed
- Provide pass/fail for each checklist item
- If any item fails, rollback by restoring data/menus_by_date.json.bak → data/menus_by_date.json and report the failure.

Reminder
- This is a temporary test. After verification, keep the backup so we can revert instantly.
