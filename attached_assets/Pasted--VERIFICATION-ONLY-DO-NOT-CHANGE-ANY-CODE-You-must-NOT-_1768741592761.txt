🚫 VERIFICATION ONLY — DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE.
You must NOT modify, refactor, delete files, or apply any updates. Do NOT generate patches/diffs. Only inspect the current codebase and REPORT findings.

Context / Question:
I believe the project still uses a dummy waiting-queue dataset provided via CSV (previous PoC dataset). I want you to verify:
1) Whether the CSV-based dummy dataset still exists and is currently used at runtime,
2) Whether it can be removed safely,
3) If removed, whether the remaining architecture becomes a “cleaner service-base skeleton” (i.e., a well-structured base where swapping CSV→API→DB→real-time data is straightforward).

Please perform an inspection-only review and provide:

A) Current reality check (is CSV still present and used?)
- Identify whether the waiting data pipeline still reads from a CSV file.
- List the exact file path(s) of any CSV dataset(s) (e.g., data/*.csv) and whether they are referenced by server code at startup.
- Cite the relevant server modules/functions that load the CSV (file path + nearest line references), and describe the runtime flow (startup load, caching map, endpoints served).

B) Removal feasibility (without implementing removal)
- If the CSV file(s) were deleted, what would break at build/runtime?
- Which endpoints would fail (e.g., /api/waiting, /api/waiting/all, /api/dates, /api/waiting/timestamps), and how?
- Are there any fallback paths, stubs, or “no data” behaviors that would keep the UI working, or would the app hard-crash?

C) Service-base skeleton impact
- Would removing the CSV dataset make the architecture “more beautiful/clean” as a service base, or would it reduce the usefulness of the PoC (e.g., demoability, tests, local dev)?
- Identify what minimal alternative would be needed to keep the skeleton valid for dev/demo without real data (e.g., empty in-memory store, mock provider, sample fixture).
  (High-level description only; do NOT implement.)

D) Recommendation
- Provide a clear recommendation:
  - “Keep the CSV for now” or “Safe to remove now”
- Justify using architecture principles (single entrypoint, separation of concerns, future migration), and note any risks.

Again: inspection/reporting only — no code changes.
