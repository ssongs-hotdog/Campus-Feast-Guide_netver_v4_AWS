🚫 PRE-IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW ONLY — DO NOT APPLY ANY CHANGES YET.
This message is to inform you of a planned update and ask for an architecture/risk review BEFORE any implementation.
Do NOT modify any code, do NOT create/modify any data files, do NOT generate patches/diffs, and do NOT execute the changes now.

I want you to analyze and report:
1) Whether the update described below is safe and reasonable to apply in the current codebase.
2) What risks/edge cases I should consider (types, backward compatibility, UI behavior, routing, caching, etc.).
3) What exactly changes in the menu dataset schema (menus_by_date.json / /api/menu response shape).
4) What a dummy-data generator must account for after this change (rules, pitfalls, validation checks).
5) A clear go/no-go recommendation, and what acceptance checks I should run after implementing.

ONLY AFTER you provide this analysis (and still without changing code), I will decide whether to proceed.

🚨 IMPLEMENTATION REQUEST — LIMITED SCOPE ONLY (DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING ELSE)
You must modify ONLY what is strictly necessary to support the special-case behavior for ONE corner:
hanyang_plaza / breakfast_1000 (천원의 아침밥).
Do NOT change global UI styling, layouts, typography, spacing, colors, component structures, routing, or any other corner behavior.
Keep the existing UI visuals identical except for the additions described below.

Context
- Today, each corner’s menu data assumes a single mainMenuName and a single items[] list.
- For breakfast_1000 only, we want to support TWO main menus (derived from “[백반식] …” and “[간편식] …”).
- The server currently returns menu JSON as pass-through (/api/menu), and the client renders CornerCard (home list) + CornerDetail (detail page).
- We also want to reserve a UI placeholder for a future real-time dataset: “remaining meal tickets” (잔여 식수) for breakfast_1000 only.

Goals
A) Data Model Upgrade (breakfast_1000 only)
1) Support breakfast_1000 having either:
   - 2 main menus (main #1 and main #2) each with its own items list, OR
   - 1 main menu (only main #1) with its items list
2) Non-breakfast corners must remain unchanged and still use the existing single mainMenuName + items[] shape.

Recommended approach (choose one and implement cleanly):
- Option 1 (preferred): extend MenuItem with an optional “variants” field ONLY used by breakfast_1000:
  variants?: Array<{ mainMenuName: string; items: string[] }>
  - For normal corners, variants is undefined.
  - For breakfast_1000, variants has length 1 or 2.
  - Keep the existing mainMenuName/items fields for backward compatibility and existing rendering where appropriate.

B) Home Screen (CornerCard) Rendering Rule
- For breakfast_1000 only:
  - If there are TWO main menus, display: "Main1, Main2" (comma-separated) in the exact same place where mainMenuName is currently shown.
  - If there is ONE main menu, display only that one cleanly (no comma, no empty placeholders).
- For all other corners: no changes.

C) Detail Screen (CornerDetail) Rendering Rule — IMPORTANT
Current detail UI shows ONE “menu block” containing:
- photo placeholder (left)
- main menu name + composition items (right)

For breakfast_1000 ONLY, change the detail page so that:
1) If there are TWO main menus, render TWO independent menu blocks stacked vertically.
   - Block #1 corresponds to Main1 + its items list
   - Block #2 corresponds to Main2 + its items list
2) If there is ONE main menu, render only ONE menu block (same structure).
3) Add a new text label inside EACH breakfast_1000 menu block at the BOTTOM-RIGHT:
   - “잔여 식수: --명”
   Notes:
   - This is a placeholder for future real-time data.
   - Do NOT implement data fetching now.
   - Keep “--” literally as the placeholder value.
4) The menu blocks must reuse the existing block style/layout (no redesign). Simply duplicate the existing block component/markup for breakfast variants.

D) Constraints & Quality Bar
- Minimal changes only; do not refactor unrelated code.
- Keep TypeScript types correct and consistent across shared/types and client.
- Ensure the app continues to work even when breakfast_1000 has only ONE main menu.
- Ensure other corners render exactly as before.
- Maintain graceful behavior when there is no menu data (“데이터 없음”) for any date/corner.

Deliverables (when implementation is later approved)
1) Briefly list the exact files you would need to change.
2) Summarize the new/updated type shape for breakfast_1000.
3) Confirm with a checklist:
   - CornerCard shows “Main1, Main2” for breakfast_1000 when two mains exist
   - CornerCard shows only “Main1” when only one main exists
   - CornerDetail shows 2 stacked blocks for breakfast_1000 when two mains exist
   - CornerDetail shows 1 block for breakfast_1000 when one main exists
   - Each breakfast block shows “잔여 식수: --명” at bottom-right
   - No visual/layout changes for other corners
