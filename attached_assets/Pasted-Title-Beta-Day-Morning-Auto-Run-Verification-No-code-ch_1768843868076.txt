Title: Beta Day Morning Auto-Run Verification (No code changes unless needed)

You are NOT implementing new features right now. I want a verification + evidence report that our beta-day pipeline will run hands-off tomorrow morning and show live data.

Context

We configured a simulator-beta workflow to run npx tsx scripts/simulator.ts, and added it to the Project workflow (Run workflow task).

Simulator behavior: pre-beta checks every 60s, beta-day cadence 30s, skips inactive corners via isCornerActive, ingests to /api/ingest/waiting, writes to waiting_snapshots.

Today tab reads /api/waiting/latest?date=YYYY-MM-DD with WAITING_STALE_SECONDS gate.

Client uses server-authoritative today (refetch /api/config every 60s).

Beta date target: 2026-01-20 KST.

What I need you to verify (with concrete evidence)

Workflow Auto-Start & Persistence

Confirm that when the Repl starts (Project workflow run), simulator-beta actually starts automatically.

Provide evidence:

Workflows panel state (which workflows/tasks running)

Simulator logs showing:

token PRESENT (but never print token value)

“waiting for 2026-01-20… checking every 60s” when pre-beta

“No active corners, skipping ingestion” during inactive hours

Operating-Hours Trigger

Verify that once the first corner becomes active (based on our schedule config), the simulator will begin posting ingestion without manual intervention.

Show:

Which corner(s) are expected to become active first and at what KST time, based on CORNER_SCHEDULES.

A dry-run log or a controlled short test (only if you can do safely) that demonstrates the transition from “skipping” → “ingesting”.

DB Writes Confirmed

Prove that ingestion actually writes rows into Postgres:

Provide SQL queries and their results (counts) for the beta date:

SELECT COUNT(*) ... WHERE DATE(timestamp AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Seoul') = '2026-01-20';

Show latest timestamp row count and which corners exist at that timestamp.

Confirm DB timestamp timezone handling is correct (+09:00 accepted, stored as UTC but KST date filtering works).

API + UI Live Output

Demonstrate that the Today tab will show data automatically once DB ingestion begins:

curl /api/config

curl /api/health (secondsSinceLastIngestion should drop after ingestion)

curl "/api/waiting/latest?date=2026-01-20" returns non-empty array during active period

Confirm React Query polling is active only when isToday && useDbWaiting.

Staleness Behavior (Safety)

Verify that if ingestion stops, after WAITING_STALE_SECONDS the endpoint returns [] and UI shows placeholders.

Provide one example log line:

[Latest] STALE: ... ageSec=... thresholdSec=...

Output format

Give a PASS/FAIL checklist for the 5 sections above.

For each section, include evidence snippets (logs, curl outputs, SQL results) and explain what they mean.

If anything is NOT fully automatic, state exactly what manual step would still be required.

Do not make code changes unless you discover a blocker; if you find a blocker, propose the minimum change and wait for my approval.
