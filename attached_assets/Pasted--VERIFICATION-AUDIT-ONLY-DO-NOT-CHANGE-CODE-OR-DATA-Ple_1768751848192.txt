🚫 VERIFICATION / AUDIT ONLY — DO NOT CHANGE CODE OR DATA
Please do NOT modify any code, do NOT edit any files, and do NOT refactor.
This request is ONLY to inspect the current implementation and report findings.

Audit Goals
1) Confirm whether the currently applied dummy datasets are being consumed correctly end-to-end:
   - Menu dataset: data/menus_by_date.json (or the currently used menu JSON file)
   - Waiting dataset: data/hy_eat_queue_3days_combined.csv (currently swapped with the new dummy CSV)
2) Confirm that UI renders the values sourced from these datasets as intended (no silent drop / mismatch).
3) Determine whether, when real production data arrives, we can keep exactly the SAME data formats and simply append/accumulate data over time.
4) Identify any structural risks for long-term data management:
   - ID matching (restaurantId/cornerId)
   - timestamp/timezone handling
   - date discovery logic (/api/dates)
   - aggregation behavior (1-min data → 5-min aggregate)
   - caching / reload behavior
   - dataset growth (file size, performance)
   - special cases (breakfast_1000 variants, ramen break time, rice_bowl requiresMenuDataForActive)
5) Provide a clear “OK / Not OK” verdict and concrete recommendations (without implementing them).

What to Inspect (read-only)
A) Menus
- Verify /api/menu?date=YYYY-MM-DD returns the expected shape:
  dateKey → restaurantId → cornerId → MenuItem
- Verify breakfast_1000 supports:
  - variants length 1 or 2
  - fallback behavior when variants missing/empty
  - CornerCard shows “Main1, Main2”
  - CornerDetail renders 1~2 blocks and per-variant “결제하기”
- Verify priceWon usage path (Ticket flow) is stable with current menu JSON

B) Waiting / Queue
- Verify server loads CSV at startup and populates cachedDataByDate correctly
- Verify /api/dates returns the dates present in CSV
- Verify /api/waiting/timestamps, /api/waiting, /api/waiting/all return non-empty for dates that exist
- Verify timezone parsing and time slot alignment (KST +09:00)
- Verify computeWaitMinutes is applied consistently

C) Long-term feasibility for real data
- Can we keep the same schema and append new rows/dates?
- Any constraints on ordering, deduplication, or timestamp uniqueness?
- Any concerns about CSV/JSON file size growth and performance?
- What minimal operational process is recommended (daily append, regenerate, rotate files, etc.)?

Report Format Requested
1) Dataset Consumption Check (Menus / Waiting): PASS/FAIL + evidence (file paths + endpoints + key types)
2) Real Data Compatibility: Can we keep the same formats? YES/NO + rationale
3) Data Management Risks: list top 5 risks and how to mitigate (no code changes)
4) Recommended Operational Guidelines for real data ingestion (how to produce/validate data before dropping it in)
5) Final verdict: “Service-base data layer is stable” vs “needs changes”
