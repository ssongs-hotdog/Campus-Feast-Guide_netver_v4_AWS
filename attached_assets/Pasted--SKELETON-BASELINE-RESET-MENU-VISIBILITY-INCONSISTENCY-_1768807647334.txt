🚨 SKELETON BASELINE RESET — MENU VISIBILITY INCONSISTENCY (TODAY ONLY)
SCOPE: Make the app a clean “empty skeleton” baseline for real-time pipeline work.
This is NOT a feature request. This is cleanup to ensure the system shows no menu data anywhere unless we intentionally add it later.

IMPORTANT RULES
- You MAY modify code and data files, but ONLY to achieve a consistent empty-skeleton state.
- Do NOT change UI styling/layout/typography/routing or any feature behavior other than “data presence”.
- No new features. No refactors beyond what is strictly needed.
- Keep rollback easy: single commit, clear diff, and document files changed.

CURRENT PROBLEM (Observed)
- Past/Future tabs show “데이터 없음” for menus (expected when empty).
- But TODAY tab still displays menu content (unexpected).
=> This implies there is still a “today-only” menu source, fallback, seed, mock, or special-case logic providing menus.

GOAL
1) Ensure menus are EMPTY for ALL dates (past/today/future) in the skeleton baseline.
2) The UI must show the same “no menu data” behavior consistently across ALL dates.
3) Keep waiting/queue skeleton behavior as-is (empty is OK). Menu should match that level of emptiness.
4) Preserve API contracts and existing endpoints. Only remove/disable unintended data sources.

TASKS
A) Investigate and identify why TODAY shows menu data
- Check if /api/menu?date=TODAY returns non-empty.
- Check if the client bypasses /api/menu for TODAY (e.g., fallback to menu.json, hardcoded seed, mock provider, or cached data in memory).
- Check if /api/dates “today” key is causing a fallback path.
- Search for any embedded “today menu seed”, “default menu”, or “example menu” inside code.
- Also check if data/_backup_dummy or other files are still being read accidentally.

B) Enforce a clean skeleton state (menus)
- Make data/menus_by_date.json truly empty and ensure the server reads ONLY that file for menu data.
- Ensure no other menu file (e.g., data/menu.json, .bak, sample json) is used as fallback.
- Ensure caching doesn’t retain old menus after reload:
  - Run /api/admin/reload logic once in dev if needed to clear stale caches.
  - Ensure globalCache.menus is empty when menus_by_date.json is {}.
- The result must be: /api/menu?date=ANY_DATE returns “no data” consistently (either {} or a stable “not found” response that the client renders as “데이터 없음”, but it must be consistent across dates).

C) Verify end-to-end behavior
- Confirm with explicit checks:
  1) /api/menu?date=TODAY → empty / no data
  2) /api/menu?date=PAST_DATE → empty / no data
  3) /api/menu?date=FUTURE_DATE → empty / no data
- Confirm UI:
  - Home (today) shows menu placeholders / “데이터 없음”
  - Detail pages also show no menu content
  - No crashes or TypeScript errors

DELIVERABLES
1) Root-cause explanation: Why TODAY was still showing menu data (specific file/logic/path).
2) Exact files changed and what you changed in each.
3) Verification outputs (brief):
   - The three /api/menu calls above and results
   - Statement that UI is now consistent across dates
4) Rollback instruction (git revert) confirmed.

NOTE
This skeleton baseline is a prerequisite for Phase 2 real-time waiting DB pipeline work.
After this, we will intentionally reintroduce menu data later (file-based is OK), but for now it must be completely empty everywhere.
