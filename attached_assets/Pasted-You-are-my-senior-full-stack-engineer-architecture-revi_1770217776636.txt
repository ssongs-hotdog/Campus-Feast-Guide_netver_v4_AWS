You are my senior full-stack engineer + architecture reviewer for the HY-eat project.

🚫 CRITICAL RULE (MUST FOLLOW)
- DO NOT modify, create, delete, or commit any code or files.
- DO NOT run any auto-fix, formatting, refactor, or dependency update.
- DO NOT apply patches. This is READ-ONLY analysis only.
- If changes are needed, ONLY describe them as suggestions with exact file paths/lines, but DO NOT edit anything.

Goal
- Analyze the current HY-eat codebase end-to-end (frontend, backend, data layer) and write a detailed report in **Korean**.
- Be strict, evidence-based, and actionable. If something is uncertain, explicitly say so and suggest how to verify.

What I need you to do (step-by-step)
1) Repo / Architecture Overview
- Summarize the overall architecture and request/response flow:
  - Client (frontend) → API routes (backend) → data sources (AWS / local) → back to UI.
- Draw a simple text diagram (ASCII) showing the data flow.
- List the key folders/files and their responsibilities (frontend pages/components, server routes, dataProvider, utils, config).

2) Frontend (Client) Deep Dive
- Identify where menu/waiting data is fetched in the UI.
- Confirm whether the UI uses a centralized dataProvider or does direct fetch calls (and where).
- Check date/time handling on the client:
  - How dates are generated (today/next day, etc.)
  - How timestamps are displayed (timezone +09:00 / KST) and whether conversion is correct
  - Any off-by-one day bugs due to timezone/ISO parsing
- Report UX logic that could hide data (filters, time selector, default date range, etc.)

3) Backend (Server / API) Deep Dive
- List all API endpoints related to:
  - Menu: e.g., GET /api/menu?date=YYYY-MM-DD
  - Waiting: e.g., GET /api/waiting/latest, /api/waiting/all, /api/waiting/timestamps, /api/waiting (aggregate/time filters), POST /api/ingest/waiting
- For each endpoint, document:
  - Input params (query/body)
  - Output schema (fields + example)
  - Any inconsistencies in naming (snake_case vs camelCase), types, or missing fields
  - Error handling and what happens on AWS/network failure

4) Data Layer / AWS Verification (IMPORTANT)
- Identify every AWS dependency used in the code (S3, DynamoDB, etc.):
  - Which service is used for menu data and which for waiting data
  - Exact tables/buckets/paths used (as found in config/code)
  - Where AWS credentials/region are read from (env vars, config)
- Verify whether the server is actually pulling data from AWS at runtime:
  - Point to the exact code paths that call AWS SDK
  - If needed, propose what logs to add (without leaking secrets), but DO NOT add them yourself.
- Check timezone correctness for DynamoDB timestamps:
  - Are timestamps stored with +09:00?
  - If stored as UTC, does the client convert to KST correctly?
  - Any reason UI would not show items due to timestamp format mismatch?

5) Findings: Bugs, Risks, and Fix Plan (SUGGESTIONS ONLY)
- Provide a prioritized list:
  - P0: must-fix to make app work correctly
  - P1: important reliability / consistency improvements
  - P2: refactors / nice-to-have
- For each item include:
  - symptom
  - root cause (with file references)
  - suggested fix steps (do NOT apply)
  - how to test/verify the fix

6) Quick “Validation Checklist”
- Give a checklist I can follow to confirm end-to-end correctness:
  - “If I do X, I should see Y” style
  - Include test cases for:
    - menu shows for multiple days
    - waiting data shows for multiple timestamps
    - AWS connectivity confirmed
    - timezone rendering correct

Security / Safety
- Do NOT output any secrets (AWS keys, tokens).
- If you need them, tell me exactly which env vars are missing and how to set them safely.
- Keep everything reversible and READ-ONLY.

Output format (Korean)
- Title + date
- Executive summary (핵심 요약)
- Sections 1)~6) with bullet points and code/file references
- Final: “Next Actions (오늘 바로 할 일)” 5 items

Please start now by scanning the codebase and reporting what you find.
