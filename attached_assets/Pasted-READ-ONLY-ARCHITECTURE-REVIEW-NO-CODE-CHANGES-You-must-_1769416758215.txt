READ-ONLY ARCHITECTURE REVIEW (NO CODE CHANGES):
You must NOT modify any code, files, dependencies, or project settings. Do not apply patches, do not create commits, and do not run migrations. This is a planning + verification report only.

Context:
I am backing up and remixing my HY-eat Replit project. I want to re-align the development direction clearly and safely before any implementation. Please treat this as a “reset + confirmation” checkpoint.

IMPORTANT:
- Answer in Korean.
- Do not change code. Only inspect and report.

Project summary (what HY-eat does):
- A full-stack web service that shows cafeteria menus and predicts wait times by restaurant/corner.
- Current stack diagnosed previously: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite (frontend SPA), Wouter routing, Node.js + Express (backend), PostgreSQL (Neon) + Drizzle ORM, plus local JSON/CSV fallback data.

My target direction (what we are aiming for):
Goal 0 (now): Keep development on Replit for speed and stability (PoC/Demo).
Goal 1 (near-term): Start using AWS for data in a safe way WITHOUT exposing AWS credentials to the browser.
Goal 2 (mid-term): Decide whether to keep PostgreSQL for waiting/prediction during PoC or to move waiting snapshots to DynamoDB (possibly dual-write).
Goal 3 (long-term): Migrate the entire service to AWS (frontend + backend + data) with a serverless-first architecture.

Preferred integration principle:
- Use the Backend-Proxy approach: Browser → Express(/api/...) → AWS services.
- Avoid direct-from-client AWS calls (Cognito) for PoC unless there is a strong reason.

Your task (deliver a clean, structured report):
A) Confirm the current architecture (evidence-based)
- Re-verify the stack and list evidence (key files, scripts, folder structure).
- Re-verify current API endpoints used by the client (e.g., /api/menu, /api/waiting/latest, /api/waiting/all, /api/config).
- Re-verify current data sources (local JSON/CSV vs PostgreSQL tables) and the role of shared/schema.ts.

B) Propose the definitive development path (PoC → AWS integration → AWS full migration)
Provide one recommended path with phased milestones and explicit “why”:
Phase 0: Stabilization checklist (no behavior changes, just verification targets)
Phase 1: AWS Menu integration (S3 first) with safety mechanisms
- S3 object layout recommendation: menus/YYYY-MM-DD.json
- Server-side S3 read plan (Express reads S3; client stays unchanged)
- Fallback strategy: if S3 fails, fall back to local JSON
- Feature flag idea: switch S3 on/off via environment variable (do not implement, just specify)
Checkpoint: The app can read menus from S3 reliably without breaking the UI.

Phase 2: Waiting/prediction data strategy decision
Provide two clear options and recommend one for a PoC demo:
Option A (Safe & fast): Keep PostgreSQL (Neon) for waiting_snapshots & prediction aggregation during PoC; move later.
Option B (AWS-forward): Introduce DynamoDB for waiting snapshots (time-series) and optionally dual-write (Postgres + DDB) during transition.
For each option:
- Pros/cons (risk, complexity, speed, demo stability)
- What changes would be required (high-level only; no implementation)
- The “earliest milestone” for that option
- How to avoid data model conflicts

Phase 3: Full AWS migration (long-term blueprint)
- Recommend the best-fit target architecture for this stack:
  Frontend: S3 + CloudFront (or Amplify if you strongly prefer)
  Backend: API Gateway + Lambda (serverless-http or a refactor plan)
  Data: S3 (menus), DynamoDB (waiting), and whether Postgres remains or is removed
- Provide an incremental cutover plan (avoid downtime): maintain current env while introducing AWS endpoints.
- Provide rollback plan (DNS / environment switch / keep Netlify/Replit operational).

C) Security & Operations checklist (PoC-friendly)
- Where secrets must live (Replit Secrets, AWS IAM least privilege, no keys in client).
- A minimum IAM policy scope for S3 read (menus only).
- Logging/monitoring basics for AWS (CloudWatch) and app-level health endpoint expectations.

D) Final outputs (in Korean)
1) “Recommended Direction” summary (5–10 bullet points)
2) A phased checklist with order (what to do first, next, later)
3) Risks and mitigations (top 5)
4) Assumptions clearly labeled as “가정”

Remember:
- No code changes.
- Answer in Korean.
- This is a planning/verification report to align development direction while I’m backing up and remixing the app.
