You are the lead engineer and architecture reviewer for the HY-eat project.

Request:
I need an overall “end-to-end” report to explain the current system to my teammates. Please write the report in Korean.

Scope (cover everything in one cohesive document):
1) Project Goal & Current Phase
- What HY-eat is trying to solve (problem → user value)
- Current stage (PoC / demo / MVP) and what is implemented vs planned

2) System Architecture Overview (Big Picture)
- Client (UI) vs Server (API) vs Data layer
- How data flows: user action → client state → API calls → data provider → rendering
- What is static/dummy now, and what is planned to become real-time later

3) Current Implementation Details (Concrete)
- Main folders/modules and their responsibilities (e.g., client/src..., server routes, lib/data, components)
- Key endpoints and what they return (menu, wait time, etc.)
- Key data structures / schemas (restaurantId, cornerId, dayKey/date format, MenuDataMap, WaitTimeMap, etc.)
- Where the “source of truth” lives today (CSV/in-memory/mock)

4) Known Constraints & Risks
- Date/time handling, timezone (Asia/Seoul), dayKey formatting pitfalls
- UI filtering constraints (e.g., “tomorrow only” logic) and similar guard clauses
- Caching/refresh behaviors, potential mismatch between dataset and UI

5) Development Direction (Next Steps Roadmap)
- Short-term (1~2 weeks): stabilize UI, validation, logging, error handling, dataset QA, test cases
- Mid-term: real-time queue data ingestion pipeline concept (camera → detector → backend → storage → API → UI)
- Long-term: deployment strategy beyond Replit, persistence (DB/S3), scalability, monitoring

6) Team Onboarding Guide
- How to run locally / in Replit
- Where to change menus, where to change UI, where to change API logic
- “If something breaks” troubleshooting checklist (API response 확인, Network 탭, 로그 위치)

Requirements:
- Output must be written ONLY in Korean.
- Make it readable as a team document: headings, bullet points, and a short summary at the top.
- Include concrete file paths and key functions/classes where possible (no guessing; check the codebase).
- Do not change any code in this task. This is report-only.

Deliverable:
- A single Korean “Overall Architecture & Development Report” that I can paste into a team doc or Notion.
