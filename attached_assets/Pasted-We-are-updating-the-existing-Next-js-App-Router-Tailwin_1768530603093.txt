We are updating the existing Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind HY-eat app.
Make ONLY the changes below. Do NOT refactor unrelated code. Do NOT redesign UI colors/styles.

========================================
CHANGE 1) Top date label cleanup
========================================
Currently the top date display shows extra text like "(오늘) (전날) (다음날)".
Remove those labels completely.
Show ONLY the date string (e.g., "2026-01-15") in the top date box.
Keep the left/right date navigation buttons working as-is.

Acceptance criteria:
- The top date area contains ONLY the date, no parentheses labels anywhere.

========================================
CHANGE 2) Replace time selection blocks with a scrollable dropdown
========================================
For Prev day (2026-01-14) and Next day (2026-01-16) pages, the time selector currently shows times as blocks/chips/buttons.
Replace this with a single native HTML <select> dropdown that opens a scrollable list.

Requirements:
- Keep the same collapsible box under the date (expand/collapse behavior unchanged).
- Inside that box, show:
  - a label like "시간 선택"
  - a <select> element
- The <select> options must be every 5 minutes from 11:00 to 14:00 inclusive.
- Default selected option must be 11:00.
- When the user changes the selected time, the snapshot updates exactly as before (5-min aggregation from 1-min data).

Do NOT use a custom dropdown library. Use native <select> for maximum mobile stability.

Styling:
- Use Tailwind: full width, rounded corners, padding, subtle border.
- No major redesign.

========================================
CHANGE 3) Hide "결제하기" in detail view for prev/next day
========================================
In the corner "상세 보기" panel/modal/page, there is a "결제하기" button.
We must show this button ONLY on Today (2026-01-15).
On Prev day (2026-01-14) and Next day (2026-01-16), remove/hide the button entirely.

Implementation guidance:
- Use the existing selectedDate state.
- Condition: render the payment button only if selectedDate === "2026-01-15".
- Do not remove payment logic for today; just hide the UI button on other dates.

Acceptance criteria:
- On 2026-01-15 detail view: "결제하기" is visible and works as before.
- On 2026-01-14 and 2026-01-16 detail view: "결제하기" is not visible anywhere.

========================================
DELIVERABLES
========================================
- List the files changed.
- Confirm: (1) date label removed, (2) time dropdown scroll selection works, (3) payment button hidden on prev/next only.
