You are working on the HY-eat project (Replit environment). We have a dummy menu dataset that must conform to the exact spec used by the server/client.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1) Do NOT apply/overwrite any production files yet. First, perform a PRE-APPLY REVIEW and REPORT ONLY.
2) After the review, stop and wait for explicit user approval before making any file changes.

Target spec (must be satisfied):
- File path: data/menus_by_date.json
- UTF-8 JSON
- Structure: { "YYYY-MM-DD": { "restaurantId": { "cornerId": MenuItem } } }
- MenuItem required fields:
  restaurantId (string), cornerId (string), cornerDisplayName (string),
  mainMenuName (string), priceWon (integer), items (string[])
  variants?: { mainMenuName: string, items: string[] }[]
- breakfast_1000 may have variants length 1 or 2+. If length=1, UI should render one card.

Dummy dataset to review:
- Use the provided JSON content from menu_dummy_3weeks_compliant.json (user will paste/upload it).

TASK A — PRE-APPLY REVIEW (NO CHANGES):
1) Validate JSON syntax (parseable).
2) Validate schema fields and types for every MenuItem:
   - restaurantId/cornerId match their parent keys
   - priceWon is an integer
   - items is a non-empty array of strings
   - if variants exists: array of objects with mainMenuName + non-empty items
3) Validate IDs are from the allowed sets:
   - restaurants: hanyang_plaza, materials, life_science
   - corners:
     hanyang_plaza: breakfast_1000, western, korean, instant, cupbap, ramen
     materials: set_meal, single_dish, rice_bowl, dinner
     life_science: dam_a_lunch, pangeos_lunch, dam_a_dinner
4) Spot-check critical UX rules:
   - breakfast_1000 variants length 1 should still render naturally
   - “closed/휴무” entries should only exist if explicitly provided; otherwise corners can be omitted
5) Report findings clearly:
   - PASS/FAIL
   - Any violations with exact date/restaurant/corner paths
   - Any risky edge cases

TASK B — ROLLBACK PLAN (WRITE IT, DO NOT EXECUTE):
Before applying changes, propose a rollback plan:
1) Create a backup of data/menus_by_date.json (timestamped).
2) If Git is available: commit backup + change separately.
3) Define exact rollback steps (restore backup file, revert commit, restart server).

STOP HERE.
Wait for the user’s approval. Do not modify files yet.
