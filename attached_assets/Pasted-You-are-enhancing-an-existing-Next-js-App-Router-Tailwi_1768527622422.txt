You are enhancing an existing Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind mobile web app for HY-eat.
Do minimal changes and keep the current UI style consistent.
Goal: Make the top date left/right buttons actually work and add Prev/Next day behavior.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT break the current "Today" simulation behavior.
Do NOT redesign components. Only add what is needed.

========================================================
DATA
========================================================
We have a combined 3-day queue dataset (queue_len only) located at:
  /data/hy_eat_queue_3days_combined.csv
Columns: timestamp (KST ISO), restaurantId, cornerId, queue_len, data_type (observed/predicted)

Menu data must be stored as a single JSON file in:
  /data/menus_by_date.json
Structure should be keyed by date string: "YYYY-MM-DD".
"today" menus should remain as currently implemented (no changes).
Add menus for:
- 2026-01-14 (prev day)
- 2026-01-16 (next day)

Use the menu content exactly as provided below (do not paraphrase).

Prev day (2026-01-14) menus:

- western: main "등심돈까스"

========================================================
FEATURE 1: Date navigation (prev / today / next)
========================================================
There is already a top date box with left/right buttons, but it does nothing.
Implement an internal date state: selectedDate (YYYY-MM-DD).
Allowed dates: 2026-01-14, 2026-01-15, 2026-01-16
- Default: 2026-01-15 (today)
- Left button decrements date within range
- Right button increments date within range
- Disable buttons at edges

When selectedDate changes:
- The main corner list should show data for that date (from the combined CSV).
- Today (2026-01-15) keeps the current 1-minute simulation mode (play/slider) exactly as now.
- Prev/Next day pages do NOT autoplay. They are snapshot lookups using a 5-minute selector (Feature 2).

========================================================
FEATURE 2: 5-minute time selector box for prev/next day
========================================================
For prev day (2026-01-14) and next day (2026-01-16):
Add a collapsible/expandable time selector box directly under the top date box.
- Default selected time: 11:00
- Options: every 5 minutes from 11:00 to 14:00 inclusive
- This selector is independent from today's simulation.

Behavior:
- When user selects a 5-min time (e.g. 11:35), the app should display the snapshot.
- Snapshot should be computed from the 1-minute dataset by aggregating the 5-minute window:
  For time HH:MM, take minute rows from HH:MM to HH:MM+4 and compute:
    queue_len_5min = rounded average of those 5 minutes for each corner.
- Then compute est_wait_time_min inside code from queue_len_5min (same model as today).
- Update the main list and detail pages to reflect this snapshot.

For today (2026-01-15):
- Do NOT show this 5-minute box.
- Keep the existing simulation slider/play as is.

========================================================
FEATURE 3: Bottom "통계" panel consistency + per-day meaning
========================================================
You already have a bottom expandable "통계" panel with charts.
Keep the same UI placement and style for all three dates.
But the content meaning changes:
- Prev day: label charts as "전날 이용 통계" (statistics)
- Next day: label charts as "다음날 혼잡도 예측" (prediction)
- Today: keep current labels

Also fix any broken selectors inside that panel (if any) but do not redesign.

Charts requirement (keep minimal):
- At least 1 line chart of queue_len (or est_wait_time_min) over time for the selected restaurant/corner.
- For prev/next day, the chart should use 5-minute aggregated series.
- For today, it can remain 1-minute series.

========================================================
DELIVERABLES
========================================================
After implementing:
1) List files changed
2) Confirm:
   - Date left/right buttons work
   - Today simulation still works unchanged
   - Prev/Next day shows 5-min selector default 11:00
   - Prev/Next snapshots change when selecting times
   - Menus change correctly for prev/next, today unchanged
